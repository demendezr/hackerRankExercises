******************
Given an array of integers, create a method that does the following:

1. Get the weights of each element of the array
2. Build a response array with the numbers from the input array but in descending order
according to the weight of each element of the input array
3. Return the response array

Example:
Input = [123, 89, 12, 67, 43] // input array
Weights = [6, 17, 3, 13, 7] // weights of each element of the input array
Output = [12, 123, 43, 67, 89] // output array

Conditions:
- It can be done in any programming language and IDE.
- Everything must be done from scratch.
- Time to complete the exercise: 15 minutes.
- The time starts to run from the moment the IDE is open.
- Share the screen and explain everything that is developing.
